Hi! This repo is a personal React-Native case study with a Pokedex UI Design gathering many projects found at Dribbble and Behance. Below, there is a list of the projects used for inspiration:

## How to run the project
In this project, I am using Expo to build the application. According to the Expo's website, it is  an open-source platform for making universal native apps with Javascript and React. Basically, it helps to manage packages and dependencies of the React app.  The main requirements to run the project:
* Clone this repo: 

  `https://github.com/andre-luiz1997/react-native-pokedex.git`
* Install Node.js 

	`https://nodejs.org/ `
* Install Expo

	`https://expo.dev/`
* Install npm dependencies

	`npm install`
* Start the app running Expo client

	`expo start`
  
Expo will open the app on an internet browser, and you can either navigate on the web or scan a QR Code and run on the phone.

Come back later for other improvements!
